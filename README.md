# LangChain RAG Application Project

## Nicolas Sebastian Achuri Macias

This project demonstrates the use of **LangChain** to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application. It leverages the power of modern LLMs (Large Language Models) to answer user queries by retrieving relevant content from external sources and integrating it into conversational responses.

## Project Architecture

The application is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Prompt Templates**: Predefined templates to ensure consistent and meaningful interactions with the LLM.
2. **LLM Chains**: Sequential workflows for handling user queries, retrieval, and response generation.
3. **Retrieval Mechanisms**: Integration with external data sources for fetching relevant information.
4. **Conversation Memory**: Mechanism to maintain context across interactions for seamless user experience.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_NAME>
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

## Running the Project

1. Open the `langchain.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute cells in order:
   - **Initialization**: Set up the environment and configure dependencies.
   - **Retrieval**: Fetch relevant data from web sources.
   - **LLM Chains**: Generate responses using LangChain's advanced capabilities.
3. Experiment with custom prompts and queries.

## Example

### Example Query
- **Input**: "What are the key benefits of using LangChain for RAG?"
- **Output**: 
  ```
  LangChain simplifies the implementation of RAG by integrating retrieval, response generation, and memory management in a seamless workflow.
  ```
